## My Projects

My passion for sport has led me to develop most of my IT projects around sport (not always😏).

Here are some of my recent projects:

- [EHB Football App](https://github.com/n4wf3l/Interschool-VA) - 🚀 A platform for inter-campus football competition among students. 📝 Distributed under the MIT License.
- [Futsal Platform](https://github.com/n4wf3l/FutsalProject) - 🚀 Creation of a SaaS platform for futsal clubs, featuring a team management system with current membership, news editing, an admin panel for customising the style of the website, a ticket purchasing system with Stripe online payment and much more.
- [JPL Team of the Week](https://github.com/n4wf3l/teamOfTheWeek-JPL) - 🚀 Team of the Week: A self-coded template featuring only football players from the Belgian Jupiler Pro League. This web page allows you to select eleven players who have performed the best. After making your selections, you can capture a screenshot of your chosen team.
